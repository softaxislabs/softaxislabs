      <li><strong>Basic usage and diagnostics</strong>: limited technical information to operate and improve the app (e.g., error logs), where available.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable administrative and technical safeguards designed to protect your information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>
